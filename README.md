Prediction of customer purchase behavior
This project provides an analysis of customersâ€™ purchase behaviors during our Fall promotions. Specifically, we used statistical methods to predict whether customers will make purchases, and if so, their purchase amount.

Our models are able to correctly identify the purchasing decisions of 93.5% of the customers, and allow us to estimate their spending amounts with an average error of $7.30. We estimated a revenue of $174,238 among the best 1,000 customers, which is close to the actual total of $165,965. Among the top 1,000 customers chosen by our model, 443 actually made a purchase. This resulted in a revenue of $57,432 for the top customers.
